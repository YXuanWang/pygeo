# Summary
In the field of aerodynamic shape optimization, the geometry of an object is often modified by an optimization algorithm in order to improve its performance.
A common example is the shape optimization of an aircraft wing, where the aerodynamic drag is minimized by adjusting the external shape of the wing.
In a multidisciplinary design optimization context, aerodynamics and structural mechanics are considered and optimized simultaneously, which often provides additional benefit over optimizing only a single discipline.
In such cases, the geometry takes on an even greater significance in ensuring that multiple disciplines have a consistent and unified geometry representation.

pyGeo is a geometry package for aerodynamic and multidisciplinary design optimization.
It provides some basic geometry generation capabilities, several methods for geometry parameterization, numerous geometric constraints, and some utility functions for geometry manipulation.
The parameterizations and constraints are also differentiated to enable the use of gradient-based optimizers.
